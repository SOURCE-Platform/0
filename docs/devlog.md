# Development Log - 2025-04-11

## Storage Volume Fix
- Replaced bind mount with Docker named volume (`supabase_storage_data`) to resolve:
  - "Extended attributes not supported" error during file uploads
  - macOS Docker Desktop filesystem compatibility issues
- Verified solution by:
  - Testing audio file uploads
  - Checking storage service logs

## Docker Configuration Updates
- Revised `docker-compose.yml` dependencies:
  - Backend service now properly waits for both `db` and `neo4j` health checks
  - Fixed YAML indentation issues
- Added health check conditions for critical services

## Neo4j Configuration
- Monitored and documented startup logs:
  - Memory configuration warnings noted
  - Server initialization process verified

## Version Control
- Updated `.gitignore` with:
  - Docker-specific exclusions
  - Neo4j log/data directories
  - Common development patterns
- Committed changes with message: "Updated Docker Compose config and .gitignore"
